This package contains a set of pd / puredata (these terms are so hard
to find on the web its not even funny!) abstractions for demoing
digital audio effects, plotting signal, Fourier spectra, computing
impulse resonses, and more.

Some abstractions depend on the expr/fexpr library
(http://www.crca.ucsd.edu/~yadegari/expr.html).
